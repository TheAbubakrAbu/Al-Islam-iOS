The Greek **sophia** (wisdom), which some later writers proposed, is not an Arabic root at all. Al-Qushayri, himself a Sufi, admits in ar-Risalah that no analogy or derivation in the Arabic language supports the name and that it is rather like a nickname, and Ibn Khaldun (al-Muqaddimah) judges wool the most likely origin.

The last twelve verses of Mark (16:9-20) and the story of the woman taken in adultery (John 7:53-8:11) are absent from the oldest complete manuscripts, Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus of the fourth century. The one verse that states the Trinity in so many words (1 John 5:7 in the King James Version) is missing from every early Greek manuscript and is dropped by modern translations. The thousands of surviving manuscripts differ from one another in countless readings, and no original of any book exists. The Quran, by contrast, was memorised and written down in the Prophet’s lifetime, and Allah guaranteed its preservation (Quran 15:9).")

The blessing of Musa says the Lord “came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran“ (Deuteronomy 33:2): Sinai is the revelation to Musa, Seir the land of Isa, and Paran the wilderness where Isma‘il settled (Genesis 21:21), that is, the Hijaz.

This is the view of Ibn Taymiyyah (Majmu‘ al-Fatawa), Ibn al-Qayyim (Zad al-Ma‘ad), and Ibn Kathir (in his tafsir and al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah). The Torah itself supports it: Genesis 22:2 calls the son to be sacrificed “thine only son,“ and Isma‘il was born some fourteen years before Ishaq (Genesis 16:16, 21:5), so for those years he alone was the only son. Ibn Kathir regarded the name of Ishaq in that verse as an insertion.")
